  Notes:
  - Each LED should be protected with an appropriate resistor (not shown here for simplicity)

##Â ethernet
Initialise ethernet connection and display IP address details obtained from DHCP

Circuit Picture:
  ![Ethernet Shield](circuits/EthernetShield.jpg)

Notes:
- Connect Uno Ethernet Shield (or equivalent) to Uno board. Take care when connecting shield not to bend pins and to ensure all Pins are connected correctly.
- Power on Uno board. Red power light will appear on Ethernet sheild
- Connect Ethernet cable (cable should be connected to a network with DHCP router/service)
- Upload ethernet.ino and connect a serial monitor
- Board will connect to Ethernet and display IP address (Note: getting an IP address can take some time)
